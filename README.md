[Kubernetes, Motherfucker. Do you speak it?](https://agonzalezro.github.io/kubernetes-motherfucker/)
===

Please, don't get scared about the title! It's a parody from: http://programming-motherfucker.com/

I tend to say Kubernetes so many times at works that I am mocked as "Mr K", so when I asked for a small project to learn Phoenix a colleague came up with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/luismiramirez/status/761275007561588736). Of course, I forgot about Phoenix and Elixir and I started working on it.

**Note: It's really really difficult for non native speaker to say the word "Kubernetes" in a way this page will understand it.**

TODO
----

- It doesn't seem to listen forever. I don't think it's a limitation of HTML5 so it needs to be investigated.
- Some more design would be cool.
